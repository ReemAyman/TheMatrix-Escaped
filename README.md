# TheMatrix: Escaped :running_man:
## Description :memo:
The project aims to search for the best solution for an environment which consists of the following:
1. **The World :world_map: :** is a grid consists of cells, and each cell can contain more than one thing.
2. **Neo :superhero_man: :** the main character (or the agent) that the algorithm should control to search for the best plan.
3. **Agents :zombie_man: :** the characters that Neo should aviod in order not to lose lives. 
4. **Hostages :standing_man: :** other characters that Neo should carry before they turned into agents after a defined specific time cycles.
5. **Telephone Booth :telephone: :** the destination that Neo should go to after he carry the hostages.
The main mission for Neo is to go to the telephone booth with all hostages (whether alive or dead) without turned into agents.

For more information :memo: : you can read this document [The Matrix: Escaped Project Description](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LvH277QbZvxZ2VZisgz3ySw3_2YSXrAI/view?usp=sharing).

## Approach
There are five search strategies implemented and used to help Neo:
* Breadth-first search.
* Depth-first search.
* Iterative deepening search.
* Uniform-cost search.
* Greedy search with two heuristics.
* Aâˆ— search with two admissible heuristics.

## Getting Started :rocket:
**Note:** You should have [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java8.html) to be able to run the project.
1. Use the command to clone `git clone https://github.com/ReemAyman/TheMatrix-Escaped.git` the project in your local PC.
2. Open the project using any software that runs JVM i.e. [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
